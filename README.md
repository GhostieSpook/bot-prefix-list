# Discord Bot Prefix List
###### We needed it.

A public list of claimed Discord bot prefixes.

## Why?
![wake me up](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5e22ed62512ab888944791ca572cf9ba2ec27262/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f476762425650532e676966)

## The list
- `example` - ExampleBot#1234 (Dean#9114), ExampleBot2#6969 (Clyde#0000)

## Contributing
Make a pull request, adding your own prefix to the list. Try not to overlap, but if you have a public bot running on a default prefix used by someone else, it's probably okay to overlap.
