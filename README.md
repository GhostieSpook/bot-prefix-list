# Discord Bot Prefix List
###### We needed it.

A public list of claimed Discord bot prefixes for new bot creators to consult before claiming a new prefix.

[Check this out too.](https://github.com/TheCrossroads/discord-guides/blob/master/developer/bot-best-practices.md#prefixes-and-chat-responses "The Crossroads Bot Best Practices Guide: Prefixes and Chat Responses")

## Why?
[Well...](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5e22ed62512ab888944791ca572cf9ba2ec27262/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f476762425650532e676966 "wake me up")

This list was made to try and prevent the huge overlaps that we currently have with bot prefixes. If you're make a new bot, it might pay to check this list first.

## The list
- `example` - ExampleBot#1234 (Dean#9114), ExampleBot2#6969 (Clyde#0000)

## Contributing
Make a pull request, adding your own prefix to the list. Try not to overlap, but if you already have a public bot running on a prefix used by someone else, it's probably okay to overlap.
